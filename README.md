# Loan-Defaulters

A modest exploration of Logistic Regression with a from scratch model evaluating the probability of Loan Default with SBA Loans.

The model had 75% Accuracy.

Increased accuracy is limited by the model of choice as well as a significantly unbalanced dataset.
To counter this, I employed L1 Regularzation which had significant but not perfect affect.
